# Correcting-paragraphs-of-spoken-english-to-written-english
Created a reusable library that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english. For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.
